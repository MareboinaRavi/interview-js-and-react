Certainly! Here's another example of advanced JavaScript code that showcases the concept of generators:

```javascript
function* fibonacciGenerator() {
  let previous = 0;
  let current = 1;

  while (true) {
    yield current;
    const next = previous + current;
    previous = current;
    current = next;
  }
}

const fibonacci = fibonacciGenerator();

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(fibonacci.next().value);
}
```

In this code, we define a generator function `fibonacciGenerator` using the `function*` syntax. Generators are special functions that can be paused and resumed during their execution, allowing for the generation of a sequence of values over time.

Inside the generator function, we have an infinite loop (`while (true)`) that generates the Fibonacci sequence. The `yield` keyword is used to pause the generator and yield the current value (`current`) to the caller.

We then create an instance of the generator by calling `fibonacciGenerator()`, which returns an iterator. We assign this iterator to the variable `fibonacci`.

Finally, we use a `for` loop to iterate 10 times and log the values generated by calling `next().value` on the `fibonacci` iterator. Each time we call `next()`, the generator resumes its execution from where it left off, computes the next Fibonacci number, and yields it.

When executed, the code will log the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence:

```
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
55
```

This example demonstrates how generators can be used to create functions that can generate a series of values on-demand, providing a convenient way to work with sequences or infinite streams of data.
